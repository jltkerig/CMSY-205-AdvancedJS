<!--
This exercise has you make a minor modification to the FAQs application in chapter 6.  When youâ€™re done, this application should work the same as before, except that only one answer can be displayed at a time.  In other words, when the user clicks on a heading to display the answer, the other answers must be hidden.  This takes just a few more lines of code, but you have to think it through.
 
Rewrite the code in the JavaScript file so only one answer can be displayed at a time.  Modify the FAQs application.
