Problem-5: Redo a Future Value application with jQuery (25 points)

In this problem, youâ€™ll rewrite the code for a Future Value application that uses JavaScript with jQuery.  That will show you how jQuery can simplify an application, but also that JavaScript is still needed with jQuery applications.

Open the HTML and JavaScript files provided as startup files.  Then, run the application to refresh your memory about how it works.
Add a script element to the HTML file that gives you access to the jQuery library.
Rewrite the code in the JavaScript file so it uses as much jQuery as possible. That includes the code for the ready and click event methods.
When you have the application working right, add a JavaScript statement that moves the focus to the Investment Amount text box each time the Calculate button is clicked.
